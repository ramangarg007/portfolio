## Projects
### Crime Rate Econometric Analysis
[Project](https://github.com/ramangarg007/Crime-Rate-Econometric-Analysis)

Understanding how apprehension and punishment probabilities impact crime rates is essential for shaping evidence-based policies. Research on the criminal justice system's deterrence effect offers insights into criminal behavior and informs resource allocation. By analyzing how these probabilities affect crime participation, policymakers can develop strategies to improve deterrence and reduce crime.
